## Concept

`dbx` simplifies Databricks workflows development, deployment and launch across multiple
environments. It also helps to package your project and deliver it to
your Databricks environment in a versioned fashion. Designed in a
CLI-first manner, it is built to be actively used both inside CI/CD
pipelines and as a part of local tooling for rapid prototyping.
